# One Day Projects

Things I programmed on a day or two that are too small for deserving their own repository.

### [Minesweeper](./001-minesweeper)

Tags: __*HTML*__, __*JS*__, __*Game*__, __*Solver*__

A playable version of Minesweeper with a simple automatic solver.

### [Sudoku](./002-sudoku)

Tags: __*HTML*__, __*JS*__, __*Solver*__

A solver for Sudoku loosely based on [this python solver](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html) for the browser with visualization. The solver is very flexible and can not only solve 9x9 but also 16x16 and 25x25 grids.

### [Splay Tree](./003-splay-tree)

Tags: __*C++*__, __*Data Structures*__

A very simple unoptimized and very badly but functioning implementation of a splay tree. A splay tree is self-organizing but not self-balancing: An accessed node gets moved to the root of the tree so that accassing the same elements repeatedly is very fast.

### [Percentiles](./004-percentiles)

Tags: __*Python*__, __*Statistics*__

Calculate percentiles with better time complexity than sorting using _kth element_.

### [Hashmaps in Rust](./005-rust-hashmaps)

Tags: __*Rust*__, __*Data Structures*__

Open and closed addressing hashmaps with some simple optimizations written in Rust.
